# SOLID Principles in C++

This repository demonstrates the SOLID principles of object-oriented design in C++.

## Dependencies

This project requires a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and standard C++ libraries.  No external libraries are strictly required for this specific example, as it relies on standard C++ features.  However, for more complex applications, you might consider using a build system like CMake to manage dependencies.

## Build Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:hosseinimasuod/solid-cpp.git
    cd solid-cpp
    ```

2.  **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o solid_example
    ```

## Run the Code

```bash
./solid_example
